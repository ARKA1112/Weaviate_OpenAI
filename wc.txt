The 2023 Cricket World Cup, officially known as the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, was the 13th edition of the Cricket World Cup. It started on 5 October and concluded on 19 November 2023, with Australia winning the tournament.[1] A quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by national teams, it was organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Ten national teams participated in the tournament.

It was the first men's Cricket World Cup which India hosted solely. The tournament took place in ten different stadiums, in ten cities across the country. In the first semi-final India beat New Zealand, and in the second semi-final Australia beat South Africa. The final took place between India and Australia at Narendra Modi Stadium on 19 November with Australia winning the title for the sixth time.[2]

The top eight placed teams in the tournament's final points table qualified for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, the next ICC ODI tournament. Virat Kohli was the player of the tournament and also scored the most runs; Mohammed Shami was the leading wicket-taker. A total of 1,250,307 spectators attended matches, the highest number in any cricket World Cup to date.[3]

Background
Originally, the competition was to be played from 9 February to 26 March 2023.[4][5] In July 2020 it was announced that that the tournament would be moved to October and November as a result of the qualification schedule being disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[6][7] The ICC released the tournament schedule on 27 June 2023.[8][9]

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had threatened to boycott the competition after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in Pakistan.[10][11] This issue was resolved in June 2023 after the Asian Cricket Council announced that the competition would be hosted using a hybrid model proposed by the PCB, with nine of the 13 matches in the competition played in Sri Lanka.[12][13]

This was the first ICC World Cup in which penalties for slow over-rates were given to bowling sides if they did not complete their 50 overs in the stipulated time. On-field umpires could penalise the bowling team by not allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle.[14]

Other than India, who qualified as hosts, all teams had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands and Sri Lanka securing the final two places via the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe during June and July 2023.

As a result of the qualifying process, the competition was the first not to include former winners West Indies, who failed to progress for the first time after their defeat to Scotland.[15] Full members Ireland and Zimbabwe also missed out on qualification, meaning three of the four full members who took part in the knock-out qualification stage did not qualify, with only Sri Lanka progressing.[16] The final qualification spot was decided by an eliminator match between associate members Scotland and the Netherlands,[17] with the Dutch side taking the final place.[15]

2023 Cricket World Cup venues
The tournament took place in ten different stadiums, situated in ten different cities across India. The first and second semi-finals were held at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata respectively, while the final took place at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.[8]

The BCCI provided funding for renovations and refurbishments at stadiums. Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium received a new grass surface, drainage system, seating, and hospitality boxes. Wankhede Stadium had upgrades to the outfield, floodlights, corporate boxes, and toilets. M. A. Chidambaram Stadium installed new floodlights and relaid two wickets.[18]

With the autumn scheduling of this World Cup, the ICC instituted protocols for reducing the impact of moisture—including dew and rain—on pitch conditions, so that they did not give the team batting second an advantage (as had frequently occurred in the 2021 Men's T20 World Cup). These included using a specific wetting agent, and the boundary set at around 70 m (77 yards) at each stadium, with more grass on the pitch to encourage seam bowling over spin bowling.[19]

The ICC officially announced the mascots for the World Cup in August. The mascots were a male and female duo named "Tonk" and "Blaze" from the fictional cricketing utopia "Crictoverse".[42][43]

The official theme song of the 2023 Cricket World Cup titled "Dil Jashn Bole" (transl. Heart say celebrate) was released on 20 September. The song was composed by Pritam, with lyrics by Shloke Lal and Saaveri Verma. The song was sung by Pritam, Nakash Aziz, Sreerama Chandra, Amit Mishra, Jonita Gandhi, Akasa Singh and S. P. Charan.[44] However, the song was subject to backlash and bad reviews.[45]

Ahead of the tournament, it was reported that an opening ceremony would take place on 4 October 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, a day before the opening match at the same venue.[46] The ceremony was cancelled and replaced by a closing ceremony ahead of the final.[47] During this a drone show was held.[48][49]

Broadcasting
Star Sports were the host broadcaster, televising matches domestically with Disney+ Hotstar in English and eight regional languages.[50] All matches were streamed domestically without the need for a subscription on mobile devices.[51][52][53] Other countries and territories had official local broadcasters for the tournament.[54]

Prize money
The ICC allocated a pool of US$10 million in prize money for the tournament, with payouts remaining the same as the 2019 and 2015 tournaments. Australia, the winning team, received US$4,000,000, the runner-up $2,000,000 and the losing semi-finalists $1,600,000. Teams that did not progress past the league stage received $100,000 and the winner of each league stage match received $40,000.[55][56]
