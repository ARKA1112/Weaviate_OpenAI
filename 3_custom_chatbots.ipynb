It is dif ﬁcult to determine\\nwhether this difference is caused by psychosocial or bio-logical factors. Patients with severe IBS symptoms hadhigher FMT response rates and lower DIs than those withmoderate IBS symptoms in the present study. Our previousRCT found no differences in FMT response between the IBSsubtypes at 3 months after FMT.\\n4The observation that pa-\\ntients with IBS-C had a lower FMT response rate than thosewith IBS-D and IBS-M at 2 years after FMT is dif ﬁcult to\\ninterpret because there were no differences between the IBSsubtypes at 3 years after FMT.\\nConcerns have been raised about the safety of FMT for', metadata={'source': '/home/susearc/Documents/github/Weaviate_Openai/PIIS0016508522006254.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
